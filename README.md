# UPM_Factory

This project involves developing a GUI prototype based on a provided mock-up, emphasizing consistency and user experience. The prototype includes several key interactive features. A horizontally scrollable section at the bottom displays buttons for Factory 1, 2, 3, etc., allowing users to update the dashboard to show the selected factory's data. The dashboard, which is responsive to screen size, displays four sensor readings, total power consumption, and a timestamp for the readings. A bottom navigation bar links to the engineer list, the current dashboard, and the notification settings page. Additionally, the prototype indicates missing sensor readings for Factory 1.

The project also includes an account activation process using an OTP (one-time password), followed by an OTP input page. Upon successful activation, the dashboard is displayed. An engineer list page features an option to add new engineers, leading to an invitation page.

Several improvements were introduced to the mock-up, including a consistent color theme throughout the app for a cohesive visual experience and ensuring consistent gaps and alignment between elements to enhance readability and navigation. The dashboard's responsiveness to various screen sizes ensures usability on different devices. Visual feedback for interactive elements was added to improve user interaction and experience. The submission includes the source code of the app and a screencast demonstrating its functionality.
